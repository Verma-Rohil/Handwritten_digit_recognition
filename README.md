# Handwritten Digit Recognition with ANN & CNN

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using two different neural network architectures: **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. The models are trained and tested on a custom dataset containing 30,000 handwritten digit images (0-9).

### Key Features:
- **ANN Model:** 
  - Test Accuracy: 73.72% 
  
- **CNN Model:** 
  - Test Accuracy: 95.03%

The **CNN** model outperforms the **ANN** model due to its ability to learn spatial hierarchies and patterns from images.

## Dataset

The custom dataset consists of handwritten digits (0-9), with each class containing approximately 3,000 images. The images are grayscale, 28x28 pixels in size.
